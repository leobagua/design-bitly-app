# Designing and building a Bitly like App
In this repository I want to cover and show the process to create a `scalable`, `reliable`, `available` and `efficient` URL shortening app.
This project is based on the (Grokking the System Design Interview)[https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview/m2ygV4E81AR] course.
