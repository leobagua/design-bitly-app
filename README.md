# Designing and building a Bitly like App
In this repository I want to cover and show the process to create a `scalable`, `reliable`, `available` and `efficient` URL shortening app.
This project is based on the [Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview/m2ygV4E81AR) course.

### What is a URL Shortening App?
An URL shortening app is used, well, to transform large URLs into tiny ones! If you stop a moment to think about it, wouldn't be nice to share a large URL with 10 or 15 different params in a tweet or on an Instagram post. Short URLs save a lot of space when it is used to share content over the internet. Also, URL shortening apps can extract analytical data about who are accessing this URL over the WEB, gathering information for a better understanding over the context of a particular subject within the URL. We can, for example, transform this large Google search:

```bash
https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk03vaxlk7q1AO4j2BoLBAn4SOn3mXQ%3A1596990120331&source=hp&ei=qCIwX-K8Efm45OUPiPS86Ac&q=url+shortening&btnK=Pesquisa+Google
```
into a short, readable and beautiful one:

```bash
